- Should overlay slightly if red text below

**Still seeing old UI (boxes/headers):**
- Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
- Clear cache and reload

- ‚ú® No border boxes around changes
- ‚ú® No "Change 1" labels
- ‚ú® Small buttons appear below green text
- ‚ú® Button colors match text backgrounds
- ‚ú® Feels like staying in same editor
- ‚ú® Accept/Reject work correctly
- ‚ú® All 3 test scenarios pass

## üí° Design Philosophy

**Goal:** Make it feel like you never left the text editor.

**Before:** Complex UI with headers, borders, boxes
**After:** Just colored text + minimal floating buttons

**Like Toggle Button:** Same pattern - small button below text, right-aligned, minimal style.
