# RedGreenBlue Project Rules

## Implementation Philosophy

### Incremental Development
- Implement ONLY the smallest increment at a time
- Follow the implementation plan step-by-step, executing only ONE step before stopping
- Example: If the current step is "Create new Expo project with TypeScript template", do ONLY that step and stop - do NOT proceed to install dependencies
- Wait for explicit confirmation before moving to the next step

### Minimal Implementation
- Implement ONLY what is explicitly specified in the plan
- Do not make assumptions about requirements or technical design
- If something is unclear or ambiguous, ASK for clarification before proceeding
- Do not add features, optimizations, or improvements that aren't explicitly requested

### Code Simplicity
- Minimize the amount of code written
- Prefer simplicity over complexity
- Before implementing any generic feature, check if there's an off-the-shelf solution available
- Use existing libraries and tools when possible rather than building from scratch

## Project Context

This is a UI prototype for an AI-powered note-taking app with a color-coded text system:
- Blue: New text input
- Yellow: User-marked AI prompts (marked via button interface)
- Red: Original text during AI processing
- Green: AI suggestions
- White: Accepted AI suggestions

## Tech Stack
- Expo with React Native
- TypeScript
- Zustand for state management
- AsyncStorage for local persistence
- React Native Gesture Handler and Reanimated for interactions
- **ALWAYS use pnpm** for package management (never npm or yarn)

## Current Phase
Follow the implementation plan in `mvp-implementation-plan.md` step by step. The plan is organized into phases with specific deliverables. Complete each checkbox item individually before moving to the next. Mark items as completed with an "x" when they are done.

## Development Rules
1. Read the implementation plan before starting any work
2. Execute only the current step/checkbox item
3. **ALWAYS mark completed steps in `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md` by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`**
4. Ask for confirmation before proceeding to the next step
5. Use existing React Native/Expo patterns and components
6. Keep all code simple and readable
7. Test each increment before moving forward

## Testing Protocol
After completing each increment of work:
1. Ensure the Expo dev server is running on port 8081
2. Use Chrome DevTools MCP to open and test the app at `http://localhost:8081`
3. Take a snapshot to verify the UI is rendering correctly
4. Test basic functionality by interacting with the UI (typing text, clicking elements)
5. Check the console for any errors or warnings
6. Take screenshots to document the current state
8. Only mark the step as complete after successful testing

## Progress Tracking
- **CRITICAL**: After completing ANY step, immediately update `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md`
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items
- This keeps the implementation plan synchronized with actual progress
- Do NOT proceed to the next step without marking the current step as complete

## Documentation Maintenance

### Keeping Requirements Up to Date
- **CRITICAL**: If the implementation diverges from the original requirements or specifications, update the documentation to reflect the actual implementation
- This ensures documentation remains a reliable source of truth
- Update affected files:
  - `docs/functional-specification.md` - User-facing features and workflows
  - `docs/mvp-architecture.md` - Technical architecture and design decisions
  - `docs/mvp-implementation-plan.md` - Implementation steps and progress
  - `.cursorrules` - Project context and development guidelines
- Document the reason for any significant changes from original specifications
- Examples of changes that require documentation updates:
  - Changing interaction patterns (e.g., double-tap â†’ button)
  - Modifying data structures or state management
  - Adjusting UI/UX behavior
  - Adding or removing features
